# Basic configuration

This configuration is divided into couple files, to keep everything clean.

I would also like to thank all of the plugin creators and the [Junegunn](https://github.com/junegunn) specifically for his dotfiles (and for zoom function)

## How to install

Install all needed stuff:

```bash
./install.sh
```

Below command should do the trick:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:azranel/nvim-configuration.git ~/.config/nvim
```

## Bonus

I also use:

  - [Material Color Theme for iterm2](https://github.com/MartinSeeler/iterm2-material-design)
  - [Source Code Pro font](https://github.com/powerline/fonts/tree/master/SourceCodePro)
